# odin-projects-etch-a-sketch

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, to flex my DOM manipulation skills (acc. to The Odin Project).

The application allows users to "draw" on a grid by hovering their mouse over cells. You can also change the grid size and reset the drawing.
